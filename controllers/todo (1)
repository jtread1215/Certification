from Roy's flow diagram: 
Pages: 
-->Login/SignUp

    -->Home (input form)/(upload svc)

            -->render(Certificate)

                    -->email/nodemailer

Login -->html form (send info to db)
Sign Up --> html form (send info to db)

Home --> html form/ uploader (send info to db)

Certificate --> render view of Certificate (fetch data from db), 
Email: nodemailer. Not sure yet...

I don't know for sure where the api should go...???? Sometimes its in a public folder, 
sometimes in a routes folder, sometimes in a controller folder, and sometimes in more than one place. ????
Front end api / backend api maybe? 

do we need a server? what did Sam Maxwell say about 'provides a dev server for you'? web-pack?
I'm tired and confused. Not new. Sorry. 
If we do, the package-json needs to change the entry point (main), and we need an 'invocation command' on the scripts in the same file. 
Again, very tired.
